# Comprehensive debugging manual organized by error types for Lovable

# **Before you begin**

1. Download the file as markdown (name the file as Comprehensive\_debugging\_manual.md)  
2. Upload to your project GitHub repository  
3. Prompt Lovable 

   “Read this document \- Comprehensive\_debugging\_manual.md. Tell me if it helps you and create a prompt which I should ask you to help with troubleshooting this issue please: 

   {paste your issue}”   
4. When it gives you the prompt or a suggested fix, paste it in the chat but add this to the very end of the message

   “Before you proceed, answer me in great detail \- Why do you think this will work? Wait for my approval.”

**AND GOOD LUCK\!** 

**Bonus:** 

When looking to debug a persistent issue, there are a few approaches you can take aside from the one above: 

1. **Refactor the file \-** this will split the original file into smaller chunks and that is usually making things easier for Lovable to “chew” on your requests, including bug fixes  
2. **Load the file into Claude 3.7 or ChatGPT \-** Go to Github, download the file(s) in question, load them into Claude or ChatGPT and tell them what the issue is and attach the file and ask them to write the full code, line by line, so that you can copy/paste it back into the original file  
3. **Add more console logs \-** Simply ask Lovable to add more console logs after each critical step of the function you are trying to build and that will help it diagnose the error more granulary.    
4. **Ask Lovable to help you create a better prompt \-** I will best illustrate this using an example from one of the apps I was building: 

   “Ok, think this through please, deeply analyze.   
     
   1\. You scrape the recipe  
   2\. You find 9 ingredients  
   3\. You parse just 1 of them, even though all data is readily available in the edge function logs   
     
   Audit the code responsible for displaying the edge function "result" into the UI, and see if it has limited capabilities of writing just 1 ingredient vs all 9 or as many as the edge function returns?   
     
   DONT CODE, LET'S DIAGNOSE THIS.   
     
   GIVE ME A BETTER PROMPT SO THAT I CAN ASK YOU HOW TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE HERE”  
     
   The last sentence is critical as Lovable will return an explanation and a prompt you can copy/paste in the chat to help it diagnose the problem more deeply.

# **Type Mismatches & TypeScript Errors** 

Prompt template:  
Please analyze this TypeScript error:  
1\. Show the relevant type definitions from both DB schema and TypeScript  
2\. Trace the data transformation pipeline  
3\. Identify where types diverge  
4\. Suggest fixes that maintain type safety

### Understanding Type Errors

When you encounter a TypeScript error, it's crucial to understand what the compiler is telling you. Here's how to interpret common errors:

1\. Property Missing Errors  
When TypeScript says "Property X is missing", it means your object shape doesn't match what's expected. Think of it like a puzzle piece missing a tab that should fit into another piece.

2\. Possible Undefined Errors  
These occur when TypeScript thinks a value might not exist. It's like reaching into a cookie jar \- you need to check if there's actually a cookie there before trying to eat it.

3\. Type Assignment Errors  
When one type doesn't match another, it's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole. TypeScript is telling you the shapes don't match.

### Debugging Strategy

Step 1: Identify the Source

* Look at where the data originates (database, API, user input)  
* Track how it flows through your application  
* Find where the type mismatch first occurs

Step 2: Compare Types

* Look at your database schema  
* Check your TypeScript interfaces  
* Compare them side by side  
* Note any mismatches in:  
* Property names  
* Data types  
* Optional vs required fields

Step 3: Check Data Transformations

* Look for places where data is transformed  
* Verify that transformations maintain type safety  
* Check for implicit type conversions

Step 4: Common Patterns  
Think about these common scenarios:

* Database numbers coming in as strings  
* Dates needing parsing  
* Nullable fields not being handled  
* Optional properties being treated as required  
* Real-World Examples  
* Database Types vs TypeScript  
* Instead of showing code, think about it this way:  
* Database numbers might be "numeric" but TypeScript expects "number"  
* Database timestamps come as strings but you might want Date objects  
* Database UUIDs are strings in TypeScript  
* JSON fields need specific TypeScript shapes

4. **Best Practices for Debugging Database Issues:**  
* **Always check database configuration (triggers, RLS, functions) first**  
* **Review logs from both client and server**  
* **Look for any automatic processes that might override manual changes**


**For future reference, when dealing with database-related issues, starting with "Please check all database triggers, functions, and RLS policies that might affect \[specific operation\]" will help me identify such issues much faster.**

### Handling Optional Data

Think of it like a form:

Some fields are required (must be filled)  
Some are optional (can be left blank)  
Your types should reflect this reality

## Best Practices

### Type Safety First

* Always define expected shapes  
* Don't use 'any' as an escape hatch  
* Think about null and undefined

### Consistent Naming

* Use the same property names throughout  
* Be consistent with casing  
* Match database column names when possible

### Documentation

* Comment complex type relationships  
* Explain why certain types are chosen  
* Document any special handling

### Testing

* Test with real data shapes  
* Verify edge cases  
* Check null/undefined handling

# Data Flow Issues (UI not reflecting DB)

 Prompt template:  
I have a mismatch between database and UI values. Please:  
1\. Show the data flow: DB → API → State → UI  
2\. Check query/mutation invalidation patterns  
3\. Verify data transformations at each step  
4\. Add console.logs at critical points  
5\. Review RLS policies that might affect data access

### Understanding Data Flow Problems

### The Data Pipeline

Think of data flow like a river system:

* The Database is the source (lake)  
* The API calls are the rivers  
* The State management is like reservoirs  
* The UI components are like irrigation systems

When your UI isn't showing the right data, there's a blockage somewhere in this system.

### Common Data Flow Issues

1\. Stale Data

* Like looking at yesterday's weather forecast  
* Data in UI doesn't update when database changes  
* Cache might be holding onto old information  
* Query invalidation might not be triggering

2\. Data Transformation Problems

* Like a translation getting garbled  
* Data changes shape as it moves through the app  
* Numbers become strings  
* Dates lose their formatting  
* Arrays get flattened unexpectedly

3\. State Management Issues

* Like a broken gauge showing wrong readings  
* State updates don't trigger re-renders  
* Multiple sources of truth conflict  
* Race conditions in async updates

### How to Debug Data Flow

1\. Follow the Data Journey  
Start at the database and check each step:

* Is the query correct?  
* Is the API returning expected data?  
* Is state management capturing updates?  
* Is the UI receiving the right props?

2\. Check the Timing

* When should data update?  
* What triggers the updates?  
* Are updates happening in the right order?  
* Is there a delay that matters?

3\. Verify Data Shapes

* What does the data look like leaving the database?  
* How does it change through transformations?  
* What shape does the UI expect?  
* Where might transformations fail?

## Real-World Examples

### Admin Dashboard Scenarios

* User list not refreshing after updates  
* Statistics showing wrong numbers  
* Filters not affecting displayed data  
* Sorting not persisting
